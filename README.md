learn [Helm](https://helm.sh/) - The package manager for Kubernetes

## concepts

- similar to apt, yum, homebrew, but for k8s
- Helm is the only package manager specifically for Kubernetes applications. You can package your applications as a Helm Chart, and then install, update, and roll back your Kubernetes applications using Helm.
- a vanilla k8s app deployment consists of several yaml files to describe the k8s artifacts in a declarative manner.

> Helm is a tool that allows you to create deployment templates. This template is called a helm chart, which consists of the yaml files that look more or less like a regular k8s yaml file but have some variables in them. Those variables can be defined through an additional values.yaml file.

## helm chart dir structure

- `Chart.yaml` - top-level chart metadata. e.g. name, version, etc.
- `values.yaml` - declare variables here that are used in the `templates/*.yaml` files

```sh
$ helm create demo
